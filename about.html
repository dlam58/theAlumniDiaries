	<h1>theAlumniProject</h1>
	<p>theAlumniProject is a podcast about the recently graduated as we grapple with ... working. This podcast that comes from my first year experiences and conversations with my friends. I wanted to create a space, free of judgement and full of authentic stories and experiences, so we can talk about that work that defines so much of our identities in our 20s. Questions I personally had / have, is it always this sh!tty in your 20s? Is this a rite of passage? </p>
