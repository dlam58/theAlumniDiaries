		<p>Dr. Meg Jay states in her book, <i>The Defining Decade</i>, that our 20s are the most transformative years of our lives as we hone in on the different aspects of our identities. One of the most important components that define who we are are the careers we pursue and the work that we choose to dedicate our time to. Studies show that the work we choose to pursue in our 20s profoundly affects the trajectory of our careers in the future. Yet, we don’t talk about the work that’s done in our 20s. There are a myriad of stories, conversations and interviews with individuals in their 30s and 40s, who have “made it,” but what happens between graduating college and “making it?” What happens during the most “defining decade” of our life as we’re tripping, falling and stumbling (or hopefully not) over ourselves?</p>

		<p>The Alumni Diaries aims to fill this gap in the narrative by chronicling the triumphs, the sob stories and the lessons of twenty year olds as we stumble through the workplace.</p>

		<p> Diana Lam graduated Duke University in 2016 with a Bachelor of Science in Economics and Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science. She is currently working as an investment banking analyst. During her free time, Diana enjoys reading books, eating in the East Village and building things with code. 

		<p>This project is her way of highlighting all the interesting and mundane things that people in their 20s do for work. She hopes that these stories will provide anyone starting their career or looking for their next job with the tools they need to ask the right questions. </p>
