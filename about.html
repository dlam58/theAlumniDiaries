	<h1>the Alumni Diaries</h1>
		<p>Dr. Meg Jay states in her book, <i>The Defining Decade<i>, that our 20s are the most transformative years of our lives as we hone in on the different aspects of our identities. One of the most important aspects of our identities are the careers we pursue and the work that we choose to dedicate our time to. Studies show that the work we choose to pursue in our 20s profoundly affects the trajectory of our careers in the future. Yet, we don’t talk about the work that’s done in our 20s. There are a myriad of stories, conversations and interviews with individuals in their 30s and 40s, who have “made it,” but what happens between graduating college and “making it?” What happens during the most “defining decade” of our life as we’re tripping, falling and stumbling (or hopefully not) over ourselves </p>

		<p>The Alumni Diaries aims to fill this gap in the narrative by chronicling the triumphs, the sob stories and the lessons of twenty year olds as we stumble through the workplace.</p>
